
#potassium_magnesium
at the planting, 
made a blueberry[gate.e..b..bluecrop] flower and give_berries, which dried out with the branch (prob. due to heat).
all other blueberries didn't flower.

a lingonberry grew better and developped flovers (gate.e..l..red_pearl2), if 1 tbs of potassium_magnesium was added at the planting.
after planting,a lingonberry [pond.E1..red_pearl1] close to 1 tsp. of PM grew the fastest. it died due to uprooting.
+for blu,
+for lng,?for crn



#cutting_roots #transplanting
a blueberry[pond.E1..nortland] was transplanted twice, half its roots were severed. it grew better than its "normal" neighbour (~.reka).

#transplanting
a gooseberry (gate.goose.yantarniy) was transplanted, and grew very well with a good crop.

#no_fertiliser
at the planting time = best results for lingonberries(pond.E1..red_pearl)

#coffee_grounds
at the planting,
didn't make a lingonberry grow well (gate.e..l..red_pearl1), as opposed to the other one (...red_pearl2)

#diammofoska
at the planting,
a lingonberry grew better and developped flovers (gate.e..l..red_pearl2) is OK, 
but probably because of other reasons (see "gate.e..l..red_pearl2")
